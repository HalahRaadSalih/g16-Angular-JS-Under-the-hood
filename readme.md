## Angular JS Under the hood

This repo is for angularjs concepts and what's going on under the hood. 

### Questions

- what is a digest cycle?
- what is $watch? 
- what does apply do?
- what is the difference between `$scope.$digest` and `$scope.$apply`?
- what is the `$rootscope`?


###Notes:

 - scope is an object.
 - pass data between controllers? using services, don't say rootscope.
